# Maps
The XML & map region files for PGM servers on Project Hive. PVP servers run the open source PGM plugin https://github.com/Clan-MC/PGM

Map files here are a mixture of our own maps and maps from https://mcresourcepile.github.io/ which needed conversion. XML documents here are free to use, so long as you have permission to use the map. You must seek permission from the Author of each map in order to use it from this repository, maps made by IcyCode are not authorised for commercial use outside of Project Hive.

We do not own any of the maps from MCResourcePile and the maps hosted there are licensed under the Creative Commons License.
