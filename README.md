# Maps
The XML files for PGM servers on ClanMC. PVP servers run the open source PGM plugin https://github.com/Clan-MC/PGM

Map XML files here are a mixture of our own maps and maps from https://mcresourcepile.github.io/ which needed conversion. XML documents here are free to use, so long as you have permission to use the map. We do not own any of the maps from MCResourcePile and the maps hosted there are licensed under the Creative Commons License.
